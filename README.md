# Kivama
Kivama is a simple frontend made with Kivy for running large language models using Ollama. 

### Prerequisites
In order for this program to run without errors, users must already have Ollama installed on their computer, as well as the appropriate large language model. By default the large language model is `llama3`.

### Using The Application
Upon running `main.py`, users can immediately start chatting with the large language model, by writing a prompt and then pressing the Enter button or Enter key on their keyboard. In order to clear a conversation and start a new one, simply type clear and press Enter.
